# Day 8 of 30
### Continuing from yesterday, I further refined my skills with the Material Drawer, DevTools, ListView, and NetworkImage. I improved the navigation flow with a more robust Material Drawer implementation. I also spent more time with DevTools, gaining deeper insights into app performance and debugging processes. Additionally, I enhanced the ListView functionality by incorporating more complex data sets and interactive elements. The NetworkImage widget was used extensively to load and display images dynamically, enriching the app's user interface.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
